What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository, a .git folder is created. You do it because it 
is the first step to creating a repository out of an otherwise regular 
directory. No commits are made, but you have to do it yourself. Using git init 
is just the first thing you have to do to get started.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is like an in-between for the working directory and the actual 
repository. I think it has value because it allows you to get things ready for 
the actual commit. It makes it easier to avoid mistakes and just makes it easier 
to organize things.
