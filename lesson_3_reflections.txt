When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work 
local?

  A good time for this is if I may be working on something from multiple 
  computers. In that case, I can access the files from any one of these 
  computers. Another time would be if you would like to have an external backup 
  of the project. Pushing with Git to a remote repository makes that all really 
  easy. With something like Github, it's also free. If something happens to your 
  computer, you can still get to the project from another one.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  Someone else might have made edits while I was working on mine. In that, it's 
  probably no different than not wanting to automerge the master branch 
  constantly when working on a different branch. Sure, it would keep the branch 
  up-to-date, but it might mess up what you're doing. If there are conflicts, 
  it will make you try to fix it, which might just be annoying to do at the 
  time. So, just like we commit manually, pulling manually seems to work out for 
  the best as well.
  
  
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you 
use one instead of another?

  Branches are a split off of your main version of your project. They are 
  helpful when you want to make different versions of your project or just want 
  to test some things without messing up the main version.
  
  Clones are useful when you want to copy a repository. Maybe you just want to 
  make a copy of one you have to another computer, or maybe you want to copy a 
  friend's.
  
  Forks are special GitHub clones that have some extra features. First, the 
  project you originally forked from is listed on your project. This gives them 
  credit in that it's based on their work. This also makes it easier to clone 
  someone's repository and set it up on GitHub. First, it is automatically setup 
  on GitHub already. Then when you clone it to your computer, the remote is all 
  setup.
