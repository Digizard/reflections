When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work 
local?

  A good time for this is if I may be working on something from multiple 
  computers. In that case, I can access the files from any one of these 
  computers. Another time would be if you would like to have an external backup 
  of the project. Pushing with Git to a remote repository makes that all really 
  easy. With something like Github, it's also free. If something happens to your 
  computer, you can still get to the project from another one.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  Someone else might have made edits while I was working on mine. In that, it's 
  probably no different than not wanting to automerge the master branch 
  constantly when working on a different branch. Sure, it would keep the branch 
  up-to-date, but it might mess up what you're doing. If there are conflicts, 
  it will make you try to fix it, which might just be annoying to do at the 
  time. So, just like we commit manually, pulling manually seems to work out for 
  the best as well.
